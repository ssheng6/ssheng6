#What time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible? Does this choice depend on anything? #Season? Weather? Airport? Airline? Find three patterns (“null results” are ok!).
#Write your results into Rmarkdown.
#Include a short introduction that summarizes the three results. Then, have a section for each finding.
#Support each finding with data summaries and visualizations. Include your code when necessary.
