flights

#How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?
filter(flights,is.na(dep_time)) 
#8255 flights has a missing dep_time 


# dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, arr_delay,air_time is missing. 


#Currently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because theyâ€™re not really continuous numbers. Convert them to a more convenient representation of number of minutes since midnight.


#Look at the number of canceled flights per day. Is there a pattern? Is the proportion of canceled flights related to the average delay? Use multiple dyplr operations, all on one line, concluding with ggplot(aes(x= ,y=)) + geom_point()
